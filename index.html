		<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

					As a child in Vancouver, I experimented with my parents VCRs, 8mm video camera and record player, making rudimentary films with overdubbed sound.	
				</li>
				<li>
					As a teenager I began to play guitar, before making it my goal to collect as many different instruments as possible.
				</li>
				<li>
					I have been working with DAW’s and computer audio since my first 386 DOS computer.
				</li>
				<li>
					In 2003, during my time studying music and sound at The Arts Institute of Vancouver I began working with large PA systems at concerts and events.
