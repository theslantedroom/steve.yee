		<h1>About</h1>
		<p class="about">I am a <a href="#soundengineer-nav">sound engineer</a> and <a href="https://www.pond5.com/artist/theslantedroom" target="blank">composer</a> who enjoys <a href="#photography-nav">photography</a> and <a href="#web-development-nav">web development</a>.  I enjoy creating <a href="#music-nav">music</a> and making games. I am currently focusing on developing my skills in these areas through continued education. With the concert / entertainment industy on a temporary hiatus,  I believe now is the time to finally learn to type without looking.. and enter the world of web development. I have built this site from the ground up and am more amazed by the world of coding with each new trick that I learn. Seems like we can learn anything from the comfort of home with an internet connection and a little bit of ambition, and that is awesome!</p>

					As a child in Vancouver, I experimented with my parents VCRs, 8mm video camera and record player, making rudimentary films with overdubbed sound.	
				</li>
				<li>
					As a teenager I began to play guitar, before making it my goal to collect as many different instruments as possible.
				</li>
				<li>
					I have been working with DAW’s and computer audio since my first 386 DOS computer.
				</li>
				<li>
					In 2003, during my time studying music and sound at The Arts Institute of Vancouver I began working with large PA systems at concerts and events.

				After completing my studies I continued to work as a freelance engineer while learning about cinematic music production and building a library of music.

		<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsu</p>
