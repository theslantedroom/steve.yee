		<h1>About</h1>
		<p class="about">I am a <a href="#soundengineer-nav">sound engineer</a> and <a href="https://www.pond5.com/artist/theslantedroom" target="blank">composer</a> who enjoys <a href="#photography-nav">photography</a> and has discovered a new passion for <a href="#web-development-nav">web development</a>.  I enjoy creating <a href="#music-nav">music</a> and making games. I am currently focusing on developing my skills in these areas through continued education. With the concert / entertainment industy on a temporary hiatus,  I believe now is the time to finally learn to type without looking.. and enter the world of web development. I have built this site from the ground up and am more amazed by the world of coding with each new trick that I learn. Seems like we can learn anything from the comfort of home with an internet connection and a little bit of ambition, and that is awesome!</p>

		<h1>
			Web Development
		</h1>
		<p>I am currently advancing my web development skills in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I will soon begin Git, Node.js and React, later Java and possibly C# or C++. On Nov 10, 2020, I began studying web development and I am in the process of applying my new found knowledge by building a web app <a href="https://theslantedroom.github.io/steve.yee/LMS.html" target="blank">(Last Man Standing)</a> and this will be packaged (via Electron or Phonegap) for distribution on the Playstore/App Store and Steam. Having had zero knowlegde of coding, I am proud of my rapid pace of grasping coding concepts as I have created the this in such a short time, and will continue to improve it.</p>

					As a child in Vancouver, I experimented with my parents VCRs, 8mm video camera and record player, making rudimentary films with overdubbed sound.	
				</li>
				<li>
					As a teenager I began to play guitar, before making it my goal to collect as many different instruments as possible.
				</li>
				<li>
					I have been working with DAW’s and computer audio since my first 386 DOS computer.
				</li>
				<li>
					In 2003, during my time studying music and sound at The Arts Institute of Vancouver I began working with large PA systems at concerts and events.

				After completing my studies I continued to work as a freelance engineer while learning about cinematic music production and building a library of music.
